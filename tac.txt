def load_stories(directory):
for name in listdir(directory):
filename = directory + '/' + name
# load document
doc = load_doc(filename)
Each document can be separated into the news story text and the highlights or summary text.
The split for these two points is the first occurrence of the ‘@highlight‘ token. Once split, we can organize the highlights into a list.
The function below named split_story() implements this behavior and splits a given loaded document text into a story and list of highlights.

# split into story and highlights
story, highlights = doc[:index], doc[index:].split('@highlight')
# strip extra white space around each highlight
highlights = [h.strip() for h in highlights if len(h) > 0]
return story, highlights
We updated the load_stories() function to call the split_story() function for each loaded document and then store the results in a list.

print('Loaded Stories %d' % len(stories))
Running the example prints the number of loaded stories.
1	Loaded Stories 92,579
We can now access the loaded story and highlight data, for example:
1 print(stories[4]['story'])
2 print(stories[4]['highlights'])

Data Cleaning
Now that we can load the story data, pre-processing the text by cleaning it can be achieved.
1
2
3
4	# strip source cnn office if it exists
index = line.find('(CNN) -- ')
if index > -1:
line = line[index+len('(CNN)'):]
Split the line using white space tokens:

1
2	# tokenize on white space
line = line.split()
Normalize the case to lowercase.
1
2	# convert to lower case
line = [word.lower() for word in line]
Remove all punctuation characters from each token (Python 3 specific).
1
2
3
4	# prepare a translation table to remove punctuation
table = str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation)
# remove punctuation from each token
line = [w.translate(table) for w in line]
Remove any words that have non-alphabetic characters.
1
2	# remove tokens with numbers in them
line = [word for word in line if word.isalpha()]
Putting this all together, below is a new function named clean_lines() that takes a list of lines of text and returns a list of clean lines of text.

# remove tokens with numbers in them
line = [word for word in line if word.isalpha()]
# store as string
cleaned.append(' '.join(line))
# remove empty strings
cleaned = [c for c in cleaned if len(c) > 0]
return cleaned
We can call this for a story, by first converting it to a line of text. The function can be called directly on the list of highlights.

example['highlights'] = clean_lines(example['highlights'])

print('Loaded Stories %d' % len(stories))

# clean stories
for example in stories:
example['story'] = clean_lines(example['story'].split('\n'))
example['highlights'] = clean_lines(example['highlights'])
Note that the story is now stored as a list of clean lines, nominally, separated by sentences.

Save Clean Data
Finally, now that the data has been cleaned, we can save it to file. An easy way to save the cleaned data is to Pickle the list of stories and highlights.
For example:
1
2
3	# save to file
from pickle import dump
dump(stories, open('cnn_dataset.pkl', 'wb'))
This will create a new file named cnn_dataset.pkl with all of the cleaned data. This file will be about 374 Megabytes in size.
We can then load it later and use it with a text summarization model as follows:
1
2
3	# load from file
stories = load(open('cnn_dataset.pkl', 'rb'))
print('Loaded Stories %d' % len(stories))

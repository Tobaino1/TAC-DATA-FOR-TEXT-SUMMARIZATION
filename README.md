After download, run this on the command line as follows:
tar xvf cnn_stories.tgz
This will create a cnn/stories/ directory filled with .story files.
ls -ltr | wc â€“l
Which shows us that we have a total of 92,580 stores?
Goto the dataset_tac_duc.txt file and Inspect the Dataset Using a text editor.
open the dataset_tac_duc.txt and follow the procedures
after the steps have been properly adhere to, you will have access to cnn news story and daily mail news data which you
can use for text summarization purpose on any text summarizer eg Text summarizer by Tobaino1, or any other online summarizer
like Sumplify, Text compactor, etc.

To make the task easier, the TAC and DUC dataset have been simplified
therefore you can get cnn news story and daily mail news data
